Similar to the other Colorful Screw at **Académie Étoile**, this one is closer to the top of the school on the northeast side. Use the Holovator at the **Sushi High Roller** building, and take a right instead of a left. There's a spider web you can use to make it across to this building. From the edge, facing the academy, use your Roll move, followed by a Roto-Glide, and you should safely make it to the other side, acquiring the Colorful Screw.
