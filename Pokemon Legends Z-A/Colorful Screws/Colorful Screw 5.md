For this Colorful Screw, take the Holovator in the Rouge District on the west side to reach the top of the building. Follow the path on the right side, and cross the plank connecting these two buildings. Fall to a lower part of the roofs, where you can reach the top of a platform, collecting this Colorful Screw.
