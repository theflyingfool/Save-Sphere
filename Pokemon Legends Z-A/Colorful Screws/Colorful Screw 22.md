There's a Colorful Screw on the **Passage du Palais** building. You can reach it by climbing to the top of the obstacle course at **Rouge Sector 8**, at the center of the buildings, and then head north, to the east side of Passage du Palais, and use your Roto-Glide to reach the other side. You can then make your way west, where you'll find the Colorful Screw on the edge.
