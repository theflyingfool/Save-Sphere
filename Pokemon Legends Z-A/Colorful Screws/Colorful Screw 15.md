You can find a Colorful Screw on top of the building between **Rouge Sector 7** and **Sector 5**. To reach it, use the ladder south of the building at Sector 7, next to the training court. When you reach the top, follow the path until you find a small platform next to crates. Stand on the crates, and then fly across using a Roto-Glide to reach the build, and you'll find it behind a chimney.
