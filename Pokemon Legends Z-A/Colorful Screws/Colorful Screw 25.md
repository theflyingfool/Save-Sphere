This is the final Colorful Screw in the Rouge District. It's next to **Restaurant Le Wow**, on the northeast side of the Galerie de la Lune. There are a series of platforms you need to climb. Make your way up the first one and follow the path, but when you reach the dead end, fall to the left, and you'll be underneath the platforms. Follow this hidden path to find another ladder, and you'll get to a new section of the platforms. Continue on the path until you reach the top, and then roll to make it to the final Colorful Screw.
