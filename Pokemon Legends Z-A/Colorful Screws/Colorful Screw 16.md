There are a series of platforms to the north of the Rouge Pokémon Center and **Passage du Palais**. It's a similar obstacle course to the one you had to do to unlock [Froakie](https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/How_to_Get_the_Kalos_X_and_Y_Starters "How to Get the Kalos X and Y Starters"). When you climb the first ladder, turn around, and you can use the Roto-Glide to acquire a Colorful Screw on the west side of these platforms.
