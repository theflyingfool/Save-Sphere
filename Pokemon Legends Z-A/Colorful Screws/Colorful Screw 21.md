There is a Colorful Screw on the east side of **Rouge Sector 8**, next to **Hibernal Avenue**. It's on the south part of the building next to this street, and you'll need to climb a platform to reach it. The platform route is straightforward, and then you have to perform a Roto-Glide to reach the final area where you can find the Colorful Screw.
