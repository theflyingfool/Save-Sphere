You can find this colorful screw to the northwest of the **Centrico Pokémon Center**. You need to use the Rock Smash ability to get between the buildings. From here, climb up the platforms in the middle and use the Roto-Glide to go across the platforms to the ones on the north side. There's a ladder here that takes you to the highest platform, where you can acquire this colorful screw.
