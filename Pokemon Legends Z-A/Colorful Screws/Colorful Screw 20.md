For this Colorful Screw, restart the platform obstacle course at the center area of the building in **Rouge Sector 8**. Rather than taking a left, take a right, follow the path up that takes you south. You'll have to use your Roto-Glide several times to get across, and then you loop around, facing north, to get this Colorful Screw on the far bottom. You have to time your glide to get you into this platform carefully. If you miss, expect to start over and try again.
