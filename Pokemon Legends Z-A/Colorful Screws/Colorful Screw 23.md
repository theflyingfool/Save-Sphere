You'll need to do some jumping for this Colorful Screw. You want to start on the east side of the **Sushi High Roller** building and use the Holovator to get to the top. From here, head south and make your way toward the **Académie Étoile** building. You can reach it by jumping from the southeast Rouge Sector 6 building. From there, you can find the Colorful Screw in the center area, which you can land on without using a Roto-Glide.
