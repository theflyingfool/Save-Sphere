For this Colorful Screw, take the Holovator in North Boulevard and cross the buildings, making your way toward the **Poké Ball Boutique**. When you reach the final building, face the one across the street, and use your Roto-Glide to get the lower part, enabling you to climb over the side. You can then find the Colorful Screw when overlooking the Quasartico Inc. tower.
